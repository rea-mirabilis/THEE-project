Tetraploid vs. Diploid Evolutionary Rescue
This project models evolutionary rescue in diploid and tetraploid populations under selective pressure.
created collaboratively by Rüya Eylül Arslan and Aigerim Adilbekova.

Created: Fall 2024

Project Structure
The project is organized into several key components:

1. Code
code.rmd: The primary R script containing all simulation code.

2. Presentation
Presentation.pdf: A slide presentation summarizing the project’s goals, methods, and findings, designed to communicate insights from the simulation.

3. Report
report.docx: A written report with detailed descriptions of the project background, objectives, methodology, results, and interpretations. This document also references key figures and data used in the presentation.

Subfolders:
/plots: Stores output plots generated from the simulation for further analysis and presentation.

To run the simulation:

Ensure R is installed (preferably version 4.4.0).
Open code.rmd in RStudio. 
Execute the simulation functions, adjusting parameters as desired, and review output graphs for analysis.

Authors

Rüya Eylül Arslan: Developed the code, and created the presentation.
Aigerim Adilbekova: Authored the report and contributed to background research.
